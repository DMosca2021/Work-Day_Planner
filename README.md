# Week 5 homework. Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The goal of this homework assignment was to display my knowledge of third party API's. I utilized pre packaged code from Bootstrap, Moment.js and jQuery to implement a dynamic web app that will update based on the time of day.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## How to use

- [Repo URL](https://github.com/DMosca2021/dm_hmwk_wk5_calendarApp)

The following animation demonstrates what the application should look like and it's functionality:

To use the scheduler, simply input text into the field and hit the save button. Once refreshing the page the event will be saved and depending on the time of day will be highlighted to represent if the event has passed, is current, or is in the future.
